1	-3.19935513	55.94296728	Tue Feb 17 02:20:32 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust payoff, Ian I don't think would be able to stay sane & Kim just came back & I don't think her character would survive without D
-1	-3.28251975	55.93274917	Tue Feb 17 02:20:13 GMT 2015	Can I pls have someone's phone while mine gets fixed bc I don't want a Nokia brick ygm
-1	-3.19935513	55.94296728	Tue Feb 17 02:19:55 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust Lee is pretty new and also no good motive, Ben just came back, Whitney's motive is too obvious, Les and pam would be a shit
1	-3.28251975	55.93274917	Tue Feb 17 02:19:47 GMT 2015	I WANT MY PHONE TO WORK OMG
1	-3.19935513	55.94296728	Tue Feb 17 02:19:11 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust list, I don't think they'll make it anyone else
-1	-3.1993033	55.94294634	Tue Feb 17 02:19:00 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust my final shortlist for killer/involved in anyway is Lauren, max, Peter, Jane, cindy, abi. Unless they stray from the suspects
-1	-3.2896846	55.9353277	Tue Feb 17 02:18:54 GMT 2015	How good is it when you catch an episode of Friends/ How I Met Your Mother/ Family Guy that you've not seen

1	-3.19937216	55.94293631	Tue Feb 17 02:16:55 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust and Jane covered it up
1	-3.19936341	55.94291663	Tue Feb 17 02:16:46 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust yeah someone wrote an article about it being bobby bc emma asked the ice cream van to stay open when she met the killer lmao
-1	-3.1915039	55.9502026	Tue Feb 17 02:16:04 GMT 2015	I was pretty beaten up about not working at Lush anymore but I'm realizing things happen for a reason and better things are on the horizon.
-1	-3.19940074	55.94292796	Tue Feb 17 02:15:56 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust another theory is that whoever killed her meant to kill Lauren but killed lucy bc matching suits and that would point directly at

-1	-3.1994017	55.94293018	Tue Feb 17 02:15:11 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust then again emma might've gotten it wrong OR been talking to someone who helped her cover it up aka jay/ben/abi
-1	-3.1993479	55.94297335	Tue Feb 17 02:14:41 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust hm yeah but she was shown going to ronnies wedding when emma was talking to the "killer"

1	-3.19940185	55.94293014	Tue Feb 17 02:12:17 GMT 2015	@Neizpaust obvious now bc the producer said that there would be trickery involved which makes me think Lauren or not even someone who is on
-1	-3.18085599	55.93837867	Tue Feb 17 02:12:05 GMT 2015	And I'm just spending my evenings shining a laser at the cat because it makes me laugh when he tries to run up the wall.
