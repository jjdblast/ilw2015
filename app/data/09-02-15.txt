-1	-3.21080632	55.94474647	Mon Feb 09 23:49:46 GMT 2015	Instead, he expressed some pretty dodgy views, often privately, and then went on to contradict many of them (as he did w/ almost everything)

-1	-3.21407924	55.94377359	Mon Feb 09 23:48:38 GMT 2015	But the fixation with MacD's fascism is still intriguing: for many it seems as if MacDiarmid is running for the next election
